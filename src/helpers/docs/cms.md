## Technologies Used

This project utilizes cutting-edge technologies and tools to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance:

### **1. Next.js 15 (App Router)**

Next.js is a modern React framework that provides server-side rendering (SSR), static generation (SSG), and a robust App Router system. The App Router in version 15 enhances routing capabilities and simplifies the development of server-rendered applications.

### **2. TypeScript**

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, improving developer productivity and reducing runtime errors. It ensures type safety, better code readability, and facilitates collaboration in larger teams.

### **3. SurrealDB**

SurrealDB is a highly scalable and flexible database designed for modern web applications. It supports SQL-like queries and provides powerful features such as:

- Dynamic schema definitions.
- Built-in support for relationships.
- Optimized performance for large-scale data handling.

### **4. Clerk**

Clerk simplifies user authentication and authorization with pre-built components and robust security features. Key features include:

- User registration and login.
- Password recovery.
- Two-factor authentication.
- OAuth and social login support.

### **5. Zod**

Zod is used for schema validation, ensuring that API requests and responses conform to predefined structures. It provides a seamless way to validate and sanitize data, reducing bugs and improving reliability.

### **6. CSS Modules**

CSS Modules are used for styling, allowing scoped and reusable styles. This approach ensures that styles do not leak or conflict, improving maintainability and consistency.

### **7. Environment Variables**

Sensitive data such as database credentials and API keys are managed using `.env` files. This ensures security and flexibility across different environments (development, staging, production).
